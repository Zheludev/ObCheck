# `ObCheck`
quick and crude reads to pHMM mapping tool to probe for potential Oblin-1 coding reads (suggestive of Obelisk presence)

`ObCheck` is a script-afied (thanks `Claude`) version of the pHMM mapping that was done in the original Obelisk discovery paper

This tool iterates over a set of directories, each containing paired-end reads with the naming convention: `$DIRNAME_[12].fastq.gz`

Sequentially, the tool naively translates all reads in all 6 reading frames, and concatenates this to a `$DIRNAME.aa` file

The tool then compares these translated reads against the original `Oblin-1` pHMM (specified by `-h PATH`) using `hmmer` and then picks all reads that map at the default `E-val` threashold of `0.01`

This is likely very permissive and might be susceptible to false-positives.

The resulting counts (and fractional counts) are written to a single `pHMM.counts` tab-seperated file.

One can specify threads with `-t`

# What is `ObCheck` for?

`ObCheck` is for a crude first-pass to ask: _"might there be Oblin-1 coding reads (likely derived from Obelisks) in my sequencing data?"_

If you see ample counts, it's likely worthwhile to follow up on these samples much more carefully

## if you have `ObCheck`-positive data, I would love to chat! Please reach out to me!

# What is `ObCheck` NOT for?

`ObCheck` is not suitable for any other downstream analysis, this is really for a first pass check only.

For example, if you want to do counts-based statistics including these putative Obelisks, you will need to _de novo_ (cross-)assemble new Obelisk genomes from your data (appropriately cluster, annotate, and rotate them); classify them against the already known Obelisks (so as to not accidentally invoke a new naming convention); append them to your pre-existing analytical pipeline (e.g. `Kraken2`/`MetaPhlAn`); and re-run your counting/classification prior to any kind of statistical analysis.

This is because 1) this kind of pHMM mapping is substantially different from the counting/classification methods conventionally used and so the counts are not comparable on a technical level, and 2) this kind of mapping attempts to map _accross_ the Oblin-1 space (as described in the intial paper, newer pHMMs are now avaliable) and so you lose any kind "genus"/"species" level information, meaning your counts are likely not comparable on a biological level.
